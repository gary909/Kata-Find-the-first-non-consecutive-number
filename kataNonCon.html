    <h1>Find the first non-consecutive number</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not
      consecutive.<br />
      <br />
      By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element
      <br />
      of the array.<br />
      <br />
      E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are
      all <br />
      consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.<br />
      <br />
      If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.<br />
      <br />
      The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be
      numbers. <br />
      The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers
      could <br />
      be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either
      too!<br />
      <br />
      1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ]
      though? <br />
      (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested
      for, <br />
      but you can write your own example test. )<br />
